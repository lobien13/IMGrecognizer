ðŸš€ [IMGrecognizer] ðŸš€

This project leverages machine learning techniques to perform image recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It's built in Python and utilizes the TensorFlow and Keras libraries for deep learning.


âœ¨ Features:
-The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, a collection of hand-drawn digits.
-It applies data augmentation techniques, including rotation, shifting, shearing, zooming, and horizontal flipping to enhance training data diversity.
-A CNN architecture is implemented, consisting of convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
-The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function.
-It uses callbacks for model checkpointing and early stopping to prevent overfitting.
-After training, the model's accuracy is evaluated on a separate test dataset
